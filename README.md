# Weather Forecasting Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a weather forecasting project, part of the GSG Data Science training program. 
The project predicts Tmin and Tmax temperatures for the next 5 days at 5 different weather stations in Korea using time series models.
It also includes user authentication via Flask and model deployment in a Flutter mobile app.

## Features

- Time Series Forecasting: Predict Tmin and Tmax for 5 days at 5 stations.
- Multiple Stations: Temperature forecasts for each station.
- Authentication: Flask-based user authentication.
- Model Deployment: Trained models deployed to a Flutter app.

## Structure

- `data/`: Datasets for model training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model development.
- `src/`: Flask server for user authentication and models deployment.
- `models/`: Trained ML models.
- `flutter_app/`: Flutter mobile app for temperature visualization.
